Perception - grouping of class of pulldown selection categories together.
Don't mix, genre with publishing dates since they are quite different
categories.
Attention - Highlighting the platform (PC/xbox/ps4/switch) selection first,
since this guides the rest of the selections
Retention - use of pull down selection so the user does not have to
remember the categories they are allowed to choose from.
